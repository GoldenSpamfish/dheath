Hi User! Welcome to the bank! Generally the software is intuitive, and guides you through its use itself. 
A few good things to know: 

A username and password are used to determine which account is logged in. 

The admin accounts are Ryan Ellis, with password "quake" and David Heath with password "admin".
The user accounts are Phil Swift, with password "flex", and Guy Feiri with password "flavortown".

Also to note. Some of the task noted in the assignment sheet may be bundeled within menus, so make sure you try them all.
